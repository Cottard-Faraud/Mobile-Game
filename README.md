# Mobile-Game
Small 2D multiplayer game using Unity 2020.3.0f1 made in two days (WIP).

This multiplayer game is a race between two players, in a 2D-environment. The multiplayer works both on local and online. The cubes move automatically forward, and the players need to jump at the right time to avoid traps (that slow them down).

There are also bonus items the players can use to spice things up : shoot missiles ahead or lay traps behind you to slow the other player, or gain a boost of speed and invincibility.

The first player that finishes the race is the winner!
